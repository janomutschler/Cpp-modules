# 🚀 C++ Modules – 42 Heilbronn

This repository contains all 10 C++ Modules I completed as part of the 42 Heilbronn curriculum.

The goal of these modules was to build a strong foundation in Modern C++ (C++98 standard), object-oriented programming, memory management, templates, STL, and advanced language features.

Each module is structured as an independent project with its own exercises.

# 📚 Overview of Modules
	Module			Main Concepts

	• CPP00			Classes, member functions, basic OOP
	
	• CPP01			Memory allocation, references, pointers
	
	• CPP02			Canonical form, operator overloading
	
	• CPP03			Inheritance
	
	• CPP04			Polymorphism, abstract classes
	
	• CPP05			Exceptions
	
	• CPP06			Casting (static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast)
	
	• CPP07			Templates
	
	• CPP08			Templated containers, iterators
	
	• CPP09			STL, containers, algorithms

# 🧠 What I Learned

Through these modules I developed:

		• Deep understanding of OOP design
		
		• Rule of Three / Canonical Form
		
		• Proper memory management without leaks
		
		• Polymorphism & virtual functions
		
		• Custom exception handling
		
		• Template programming
		
		• Iterator logic
		
		• STL containers (vector, list, deque, map, stack)
		
		• Algorithmic thinking (RPN, Ford-Johnson merge-insertion sort)

The later modules (especially CPP08 & CPP09) strengthened my ability to:

		• Write generic and reusable code
		
		• Work with iterators and container abstractions
		
		• Analyze algorithmic complexity
		
		• Implement non-trivial sorting logic

# 🛠 Compilation

All projects are written in C++98 and compiled with:

		c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98


Each module contains its own Makefile.

To compile a module:

	cd CppXX
	cd exXX
	make

# 🎯 Why This Matters

These modules built the foundation for:

	• Systems programming
	
	• Backend development
	
	• Performance-critical applications
	
	• Understanding how higher-level languages (like Python) work internally
	
	• Writing safe and predictable C++ code

They significantly improved my ability to think about:

	• Ownership
	
	• Resource management
	
	• Abstraction
	
	• Generic programming
	
	• Algorithmic efficiency

# 📌 About Me

I am a student at 42 Heilbronn and currently focusing on strengthening my foundations in low-level programming, STL, and algorithmic design — with long-term interest in AI/ML and systems-level software engineering.
